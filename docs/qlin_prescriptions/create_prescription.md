# Create a New Prescription

To create a new analysis and request prescription for a patient or family, click the ‘Create a New Prescription’ button on the homepage.

## Analysis Selection

Use the combo box to select the condition and gene panel to be analyzed. The clinical signs, family members, and prescribed analysis will depend on the selected condition.

## (1) Patient Identification

Once the prescribing institution is selected, entering the file number and/or RAMQ number is necessary to identify the patient. If the patient already exists in Qlin, their information will be displayed and editable. Otherwise, identification information must be entered before proceeding to the next step of the form.

Identification information for a fetus or newborn can be entered in the ‘Additional Information’ section if needed.

## (2) Clinical Signs

Check one or more observed clinical signs from the list of checkboxes. Once checked, a mandatory combo box will allow you to select the age of onset of the clinical sign. If the observed clinical sign is not part of the preconfigured list according to the chosen analysis, you can add a clinical sign with the (+) link and search based on the name or HPO code. At least one observed clinical sign is required before proceeding to the next step of the form.

If needed, you can add one or more unobserved clinical signs and a general clinical comment in the fields provided.

## (3) Paraclinical Examinations

A list of paraclinical examinations related to the condition and gene panel to be analyzed is provided. Indicate if the examination has been performed using the “Abnormal” or “Normal” radio buttons. If the examination is abnormal, a choice of result is offered, specifically based on the examination.

If needed, you can add other paraclinical examinations in the fields provided.

## (4) History and Diagnostic Hypothesis

Once the “Report Relevant Health Conditions” box is checked, it is possible to enter one or more health conditions and specify a parental link for each.

Indicate the presence of consanguinity and the patient’s ethnicity.

Write the diagnostic hypothesis in the free text field provided. Entering a diagnostic hypothesis is mandatory to submit a prescription.

## (5) Submit

Review the prescription and add a general comment if necessary before submitting it.
