# Filter Manager

The Filter Manager allows you to save, combine, and share one or more queries. A query is based on one or more filters from the filter sidebar.

## Filters
### Saving a Filter

The floppy disk icon 💾 allows you to save a filter for later use.
The dropdown menu **My Filters** allows you to load a previously saved filter.

Note that saving a filter only preserves the filter rules and not the result. The result may change if, for example, the data is updated.

### Naming a Filter

The pencil icon ![pencil](editicon.png) allows you to edit the filter name to find it more easily later.

### Sharing a Filter

After [saving a filter](#saving-a-filter), the ![share](shareicon.png) icon allows you to copy its URL to share it with other Qlin Genetics users.

### Duplicating a Filter

The 📑 icon located to the right of the floppy disk icon 💾 allows you to create a copy of the filter, including the queries contained within it.

### Deleting a Filter

The 🗑️ icon deletes the filter as well as all the queries included within it.

## Queries

To create a first query, apply a filter using the filter sidebar.

To create additional queries, use the **New query** button or duplicate an existing query with the 📑 icon.

### Current Query

The current query is identified by a blue background color on its banner. The table data is filtered by the current query. Applying new filters adds to the current query.

### Joins

It is possible to modify the join of the criteria using the **And** / **Or** hyperlink.

When selecting multiple queries using the checkboxes to the left of the query names (Q1, Q2, etc.), the **Combine** button allows you to create a new query with a join of the selected queries. The **…** button allows you to select the join type **And** / **Or**.

### Deleting a Query

The 🗑️ icon located to the right of a query’s banner deletes that query.

## Delete All Queries

When there is more than one query, the **Clear all** hyperlink allows you to delete all queries with a single click.

### Field Visibility

The **Labels** switch allows you to control the visibility of field labels in queries. When it is in the off position, only the filter values will be displayed in the queries.
