# Prescriptions Home Page

The **Prescriptions** tab on the main page of the application displays the list of prescriptions as well as the list of requests.

Using the [filter sidebar](/qlin_genetic/filter_panel/filter_panel.md) makes it easier to view the [tables](/qlin_genetic/tables/tables.md).

## Search

Entering text in the text box allows you to **search by prescription, requisition, sample, medical record number, patient number and run number**, and filter the entries displayed in the prescriptions and requests tables.

## View

The [details of a specific prescription or request](details.md) can be viewed using the hyperlink on its identifier.

## Assignment of a Prescription

Assigning a prescription allows you to easily filter the list of prescriptions to display only those assigned to a user.

### Assign a Prescription

You can search for a user by entering text in the **Search** text box. You can remove a user from the assignment with the **X** to the right of their name.

It is also possible to edit the assignment in the [details of a prescription](details.md).

### Remove All Assignments

Click on the cell under the ðŸ‘¤ column, on the row of the table corresponding to the desired variant, and select **No assignment**.
