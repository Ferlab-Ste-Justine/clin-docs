# Using Tables

The table functionalities throughout the application are identical.

## Sorting

When a column can be used to sort a table, an icon ![chevron haut-bas](updown_caret.png) is displayed. Clicking on the column header toggles between ascending and descending order.

## Paging

Table pagination is controlled in the footer. A combo box allows specifying the number of records per page. The **Previous** and **Next** buttons allow changing pages. The **First** button allows returning to the first page.

The records displayed on the current page as well as the total number of records are available in the table header.

## Column Visibility and Ordering

The visibility of columns in a table can be controlled using the checkboxes displayed by the gear button ⚙ located to the right of the table header. Note that some columns cannot be hidden.

It is possible to change the display order of columns by dragging and dropping them in the list displayed by the gear button. Note that the order of some columns cannot be modified.

The visibility and order of columns in a table are saved in the user's profile. It is possible to reset the visibility and order to the application's default settings using the **Reset** hyperlink located at the bottom of the checkboxes displayed by the gear button ⚙.

## Exporting Data

The export of data contained in a table to TSV format is done using the download button ![bouton de téléchargement](download_button.png) located to the right of the table header.
