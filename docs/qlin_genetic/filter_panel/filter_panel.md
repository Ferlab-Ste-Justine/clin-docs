# Filter Sidebar

It is possible to filter the data displayed in a table with the help of the Filter Sidebar available to the left of the table.

## Show and Hide

The filter sidebar can be hidden to provide more space for the table by using the icon ![MenuFoldIcon](MenuFoldIcon.png) located at the top. It is also possible to show it again using the icon ![MenuUnfoldIcon](MenuUnfoldIcon.png).

## Filter Types

### Multi-select Filter

This type of filter allows the selection of one or more values using checkboxes. Use the **All** hyperlink to select all possible values. The **None** hyperlink performs the opposite operation. When there are many possible values, only some of them are displayed. A **# More** hyperlink allows you to display all of them using a scroll bar.

A magnifying glass ðŸ”Ž located in the filter title allows you to search and filter the list of values.

### Range Filter

This type of filter allows you to specify a minimum value (Less than, Less than or equal to), a maximum value (Greater than, Greater than or equal to), or a range (Between).

## Applying a filter

Once the values are selected in the filter, the **Apply** button allows you to apply them to the table.
