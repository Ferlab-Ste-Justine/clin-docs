# Filter Sidebar

It is possible to filter the data displayed in a table with the help of the filter sidebar available to the left of the table.

## Show and Hide

The filter sidebar can be hidden to provide more space for the table by using the icon ![MenuFoldIcon](MenuFoldIcon.png) located at the top. It is also possible to show it again using the icon ![MenuUnfoldIcon](MenuUnfoldIcon.png).

## Filter Types

### Multi-select Filter

This type of filter allows the selection of one or more values using checkboxes. Use the **All** hyperlink to select all possible values. The **None** hyperlink performs the opposite operation. When there are many possible values, only some of them are displayed. A **# More** hyperlink allows you to display all of them using a scroll bar.

A magnifying glass 🔎 located in the filter title allows you to search and filter the list of values.

### Range Filter

This type of filter allows you to specify a minimum value (Less than, Less than or equal), a maximum value (Greater than, Greater than or equal), or a range (Between).

## Applying a Filter

Once the values are selected in the filter, the **Apply** button allows you to apply them to the table.

### Applying a Multi-select Filter

The **…** button beside the **Apply** button allows you to specify how the selected values are combined in the filter using Any of, All of or None off.

- **Any of**: This option means that the filter will include items that match any of the selected values. For example, if you select “Red” and “Blue” and use “Any of,” the filter will show items that are either red or blue.
- **All of**: This option means that the filter will include items that match all of the selected values simultaneously. For example, if you select “Red” and “Blue” and use “All of,” the filter will show items that are both red and blue at the same time.
- **None of**: This option means that the filter will exclude items that match any of the selected values. For example, if you select “Red” and “Blue” and use “None of,” the filter will show items that are neither red nor blue.
